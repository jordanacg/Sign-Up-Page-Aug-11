It is currently day 88 into learning how to code. I'm starting to take it seriously now and I have to still set up my github.
I'm fairly new to this
Had trouble trying to justify the navbar left and right but went along with this
I started learning @media queries last week and so far I think I've been doing okay! I'm proud of this and this is currently my first project!
